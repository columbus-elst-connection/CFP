A response for Call For Paper (CFP).

## Proposal
The outline of the proposal is modelled after the [Rust Belt Rust][RBR] call for paper.

### Talk Title
Lindenmayer systems; modeling the natural world

### Talk Abstract
Nature has beautiful forms. From the cresents waves on the ocean, to the beautiful winges of certain butterflies. From the stripes and spots of animals to the branching and weaving of plants and trees.

All these patterns seem intricate and complex. Often they can be modelled in a simple and effective way. Sometimes this model let's you learn something about nature.

In this workshop we will explore _Lindenmayer systems_, or _L-systems_. These systems allow you to model various naturual forms such as plants, trees and certain algeas. Furthermore it offers an playinground for certain type of fractals.
We will not only play with L-systems, we will also learn techniques for expressing and rendering them. It are these techniques that will transit from the pleasant playground of the workshop into the toolbelt of the participant.

So come and learn how to model your favourite forms of nature.

### Notes for reviewers
Our workshop will provide participants with material that will allow them to work through a guided set of exercises and projects. From this material and interations with the workshop leaders, participants will learn about L-systems, their use and techniques to create them.

Below is a rough outline of the workshop.
* Welcome
* Introduction to L-systems
* Exercises to explore L-systems and various techniques
* Show and tell

### What format would work best for this talk?
3 hour workshop

### Who is your ideal audience?
Our ideal audience are a group of people who want to sink their teeth in an interesting topic, learn about various techniques that enables them to explore L-system and are willing to leverage their own strengths to help other participants achieve a common goal; having fun exploring an alluring topic.

### Why are you excited to talk about this?. 
Lindenmayer systems allow one to simply model a variety of beautiful forms. Note that simple does not mean easy! The contrast between the rich structure and level of formality of the L-system and the intricate details and naturalness of the forms it models is deeply pleasing.

Furthermore, it allows one to study and learn about interesting topics suchs as languages, parsers and interpreters. These skills will expand the toolbox that is available to yourself in your day to day life.

Being part of the journey seeing the lightbulb go on in peoples heads is a very satisfying experience.

### Bio for the website, about a paragraph
Phil and Daan met each other at the very first Rust Belt Rust conference. Seeking each other's company to discuss a wide variety of topics, ranging from art, philosophy, software systems, politics and the best way to prepare a burger. Enjoying the dynamic and sharing their love for Rust and the Rust Belt Rust conference, Phil and Daan sought a topic to explore at this Rust belt Rust installment. They found it in the marvellous subject of Lindenmayer systems.
